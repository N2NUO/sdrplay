rtl_tcp server for SDRPlay
--------------------------

(C)2015 Tony Hoyle (tony@hoyle.me.uk).  Licensed under the BSD license. 

NOTES:
  The SDRPlay libraries are compiled against a recent libusb - the one that ships with the Raspberry Pi
  is not new enough and will crash.  Suitable upgrades are at https://www.hoyle.me.uk/pi/ 

TODO:
  Gain is not currently supported (lack of documentation on both the rtl_tcp and SDRPlay side)
  AGC similarly

BUGS:
  The only way to change frequency seems to be to reinit the entire SDRPlay - setRf doesn't work.. this
  makes tuning slow.

  Every now and then the SDRPlay goes loopy.  Disconnect and reconnect to fix this.. no idea why this happens.
